= Msg =

Msg is a minimal static site generator for personal wikis.

== Syntax ==

Msg generates static html documents from text files written in its markup syntax.

=== Section ===

You can create several levels of sections by using ``=`` as you want. Surround the section name with ``=``.

=== Paragraph ===

To create or separate paragraphs, insert two new lines where you want to.

This is an example paragraph.

This is another paragraph. This paragraph will not be separated from the first one.

Using one newline
doesn't separate paragraphs. But this is not recommended.

=== Text elements ===

There's a common rule: use two symbols to create an inline element, use three symbols to create a block element.

**bold**, __underline__, ``monospaced``, --strikethrough--

> quotation

- unordered elem 1
- unordered elem 2

1. ordered elem 1
2. ordered elem 2

=== Reference ===

To refer to something, use brackets to create references.

This is an example reference to [[internal-document.txt]].

The following reference is an example of the ``block`` element. This will not be inlined into paragraph even if you don't insert multiple newlines.
